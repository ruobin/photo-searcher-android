Code challenge Android

Create a simple photo library that downloads images from [flickr] (https://www.flickr.com/services/api/)
and that uses most if not all of the below:

* [MVVM Pattern] (https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture)
* [Architecture Components] (https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/)
* [BindingAdapter] (https://developer.android.com/reference/android/databinding/BindingAdapter.html)
* [ConstraintLayout] (https://developer.android.com/training/constraint-layout/)
* [Retrofit2] (https://github.com/square/retrofit)
* [RxJava2] (https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava)
* [Glide v4] (https://github.com/bumptech/glide)
* [GlideModule] (http://bumptech.github.io/glide/doc/generatedapi.html#availability)
* [LeakCanary] (https://github.com/square/leakcanary)
* [OkHttp] (https://github.com/square/okhttp)
* [DataBinding] (https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/index.html)
* [Room Persistence Library] (https://github.com/googlecodelabs/android-room-with-a-view)
* [Espresso - Testing] (https://github.com/googlesamples/android-testing)
* [Firebase & Firestore] (https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/)

### TODO
1. Search for images by keyword
2. Download pictures from the flickr api and display them (Grid or Constraint Layout)
3. Implement a `Detail` screen which should show the picture in bigger resolution/ full screen
4. Add save to device function
5. Add unit tests

### Nice to have
1. Download images without using any external libraries (i.e. use native)
2. Share the pictures, use swipe gestures, custom animations

Please follow clean code principles!

Happy Coding!
